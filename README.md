# ðŸš€ Automated GitLab CI/CD Pipeline with Kubernetes

Welcome to the **Automated GitLab CI/CD Pipeline with Kubernetes** project, a robust and secure CI/CD pipeline implemented with GitLab and seamlessly integrated with Kubernetes. This pipeline is designed to automate the software development and deployment processes, ensuring efficiency, security, and scalability.

## ðŸŽ“ Project Overview
This project is inspired by real-time corporate GitLab CI/CD practices, as demonstrated in the **DevOps Shack** course. The pipeline follows a structured approach, with each stage focusing on specific tasks to streamline the development lifecycle. Below is a detailed breakdown of each stage:

  variables:
    SONAR_USER_HOME: "${CI_PROJECT_DIR}/.sonar"  # Defines the location of the analysis task cache
    GIT_DEPTH: "0"  # Tells git to fetch all the branches of the project, required by the analysis task
  cache:
    key: "${CI_JOB_NAME}"
    paths:
      - .sonar/cache
  script: 
    - sonar-scanner
  allow_failure: true
  only:
    - main
```
